In this Python project, I aim to harness the power of the World Weather API to gather, summarize, and visualize historical temperature data for 20 distinct locations. By utilizing the API's capabilities, we will retrieve one month of historical temperature data for each location, and subsequently, generate a comprehensive summary table highlighting key metrics such as the minimum, mean, and maximum temperature values.
