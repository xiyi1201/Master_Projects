In this Python project, we embark on a comprehensive exploration and analysis of movie data stored in the "movie_reviews.xlsx" spreadsheet. 
Our objectives encompass unraveling insights about movie releases, ratings, and audience preferences. 
Additionally, we delve into the realm of feature engineering to construct predictive models for critic ratings.
