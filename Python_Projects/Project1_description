**Exercise 1: OOP & Pandas Practice**

In Exercise 1, we delve into the realm of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Pandas, focusing on the analysis of baby names data by state. 
The primary objective is to create a class, BabyNames, which encapsulates functionality to explore and extract meaningful insights from the dataset. 
The class provides interfaces to retrieve the total number of births, top baby names, changes in popularity, and more.

Key Features of the BabyNames Class:

Constructor:
Accepts the file location to create a Pandas DataFrame from the baby names dataset.
Count Method:
Returns the total number of births, allowing optional filtering by state or year.
Top10BabyNames Method:
Displays the top 10 baby names for a specified state and year.
ChangeOfPopularity Method:
Lists baby names with changes in popularity, categorizing them as increased, decreased, or maintained popularity.
Top5NamesPerYear Method:
Presents a table showing the five most frequent given names by state for male, female, or both in a given year.
NamePopularityPlot Method:
Generates a plot illustrating the popularity changes of a specific name over a range of years, within a given state and for a specified gender.
NameFlip Method:
Lists the top N names that flipped gender over the years and provides a plot to visualize these changes.

**Exercise 2: Statistics & Data Visualization Practice**

In Exercise 2, we shift our focus to statistical analysis and data visualization using the "exams.csv" dataset from a course. 
This dataset includes student names, unique IDs, exam scores, project scores, and quiz scores, contributing to their final grades.

Key Steps and Visualizations:

Load Dataset:
Load the "exams.csv" file into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
Identify Outliers:
Identify outlier students whose final scores deviate significantly from the mean.
Boxplot Parameters:
Compute boxplot parameters, including minimum, maximum, median, and quartiles, without drawing the plot.
Seaborn Visualization:
Create a Seaborn visualization to represent the distribution of final letter grades. Choose the visualization that best conveys the data, with a clear explanation of the reasoning.
Additional Insights:
Uncover two more insights from the data, supported by calculations and/or Seaborn plots.
